# PLAN.md — Atlas state of the world

**Read this at the start of every session, regardless of agent.** It tells you what's actually live vs. what's still on paper vs. what hasn't been touched yet.

Sibling docs:
- [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) — the rules (don't deviate; ask first)
- [`SESSION_LOG.md`](SESSION_LOG.md) — running log of every session (append before ending yours)
- [`handover-docs/CLAUDE.md`](handover-docs/CLAUDE.md) — full history + detail
- [`handover-docs/SLEEP-ROADMAP.md`](handover-docs/SLEEP-ROADMAP.md) — sleep future plan

**Last updated:** 2026-07-27 (Phase 5 Health panel polish — pill depth on both panels + EXPERIMENTAL gradient tint in sage/coral, colors confirmed but tint concept itself not yet confirmed) · **Live at:** [atlas.abhisheksikka.com](https://atlas.abhisheksikka.com) · **Current cache version:** `atlas-offline-shell-v36` · **Latest migration:** `015_sleep_morning_note.sql`

## LIVE IN PRODUCTION (as of 2026-07-26)

Everything below is deployed and confirmed on the live app. Anything Antigravity shipped in earlier sessions is included — detected by reading the current code + commit history.

### Authentication & shell
- Real Supabase Auth (email + password). Single-account, one profile, no signup screen — Abhishek's account is provisioned directly in the Supabase dashboard.
- Session persists per-browser (Supabase default).
- Three-state theme switcher (Auto · Light · Dark) permanently visible in top header. Charcoal Muse (dark) and Paper Studio (light) — both fully painted.
- PWA installable: manifest.json + icon-192.png + icon-512.png + favicon.svg + service-worker.js with `skipWaiting` + `clients.claim`. Cache currently `v19`.
- Header actions: Notebook overlay button, Restore overlay button, user name, theme switcher, sign-out.

### Today page — Tasks & Reminders card
- **Full-width band of its own (2026-07-27 Health restructure).** No longer sharing a row with Sleep/Workout — the old 60/40 split put Health inside Tasks' shadow and produced dead space beside the shorter column. Tasks now gets the full page width; Sleep + Workout moved to their own row below (see "Health row").
- Card height follows its own content (no explicit max-height/scroll-cage currently in `.task-list` CSS — note this is a pre-existing gap from before the restructure, not something this pass introduced or removed).
- **Row anatomy (v2):** round done-checkbox on the left · task name + kind/project chip metadata stacked in the middle · right-aligned time column with OVERDUE tag underneath if past-due · **no delete X on the row** (delete lives inside Edit).
- **Project chip fix:** tinted `--surface-2` background with hairline border, primary text weight-600, coloured identity dot. Reads clearly on both themes.
- **Overdue state:** past-scheduled tasks/reminders show coral time + "OVERDUE" tag. `isOverdue()` narrowly defined (past date OR today+past time, never done).
- **Two-tap done confirm:** first tap on checkbox arms row with sage-tint + inline hint; second tap within 2.5s commits; expires silently.
- **Edit-on-click:** clicking anywhere on the row (except the checkbox) opens the redesigned task edit modal.
- **Recently completed rows are fully inert** — no cursor, no hover, no click, no delete. Undo via Restore view.
- **Empty state:** three pulsing dots + "Nothing scheduled today" headline + helper (only when both upcoming and recently-completed are empty).

### Today page — Task edit modal (add + edit both use this one)
- **Tiered layout:** eyebrow (e.g. "Task · POS_Testing") + title-sized name input (20 px weight-500) + right-aligned status pill (Not started / In progress / Done).
- **Schedule subsection:** date input + universal numeric time picker + "Notify me at this time" checkbox.
- **Assignment subsection:** type (Task/Reminder) + project (Standalone or one of the active projects).
- **Delete inside modal:** outline-coral button bottom-left, visually separated from Cancel/Save on the right. `askConfirm` modal + undo toast as usual.

### Today page — hero + KPIs + Routine + trend
- **Hero band:** streak card (left) · KPI strip (Tasks today / Active projects / Checklist ring) · streak card (right).
- **Streaks:** 56 px number, "relapse" as a quiet coral text-link (55% opacity, hover underlines), grace-day mechanic + previous-best memory. Modal for relapse confirmation with required reason + optional "use grace" checkbox.
- **KPI cards:** 40 px big number + denominator span for Tasks (`recentlyCompleted/tasksTodayTotal`); 40 px count + colour chip list for Active projects; 128 px ring for Checklist with sage/amber/hollow segments.
- **Checklist Today ring — skipped colour:** `--accent-amber` (was `--border-hover`, invisible). Matches trend chart + mini-dots.
- **Journal pencil:** icon-button next to the Today H1, real hover/focus `.tooltip` in `--surface-2` (not `title=`), toggles the inline daily-note composer.
- **Health row (2026-07-27 restructure):** Sleep + Workout panels sit in their own full-width row below Tasks, not squeezed into a 40% column beside it. Plain CSS grid (`display:grid; grid-template-columns:1fr 1fr`, default `align-items:stretch`) equalizes both panel heights automatically — no scroll cage, no min/max plumbing needed. Single column under 900px. Both panels have `.nodata` two-line helper when unset (names the manual + planned-AI-parse flow).
- **EXPERIMENTAL, unconfirmed (2026-07-27):** both panels currently carry `tint-sage` (Sleep) / `tint-coral` (Workout) — a faint gradient wash (`linear-gradient(180deg, var(--accent-*-tint), var(--surface-1) 38%)`, same tint-token pattern as `.kpi-card.hero`/`.streak-card.color-*`) concentrated behind the header, fading to plain `--surface-1` before the note chips/session pills. Colors match the Sobriety (sage) / Smoke-free (coral) streak cards per Abhishek's explicit ask, confirmed via clarifying question before building (his first message used "street court" for "streak cards," ambiguous enough to check first). The header icon chips were also switched to match (sage/coral instead of lilac/blue) so each panel has one coherent accent instead of two colors in one card — a judgment call beyond the literal request, flagged in `SESSION_LOG.md`. Abhishek has not yet confirmed he likes the tint concept itself (only that sage/coral is the right color family if it stays) — it may get reverted next session. See `SESSION_LOG.md`'s matching entry for exact revert steps if asked.
- **Routine (checklist):** always visible below the Health row. Starts fully collapsed on every mount (session-only, never persisted). Four blocks (Morning/Afternoon/Night/Sleep) with 5 px coloured left-edge. Mini-dots share colour language with the trend chart. Log popup (name + time + note). Log button muted 35% on already-marked rows.
- **Checklist Completion trend:** 30-day stacked bar chart (sage done / amber skipped / coral missed). Legend at 11 px dots + 500-weight secondary text.

### Today page — Sleep panel (manual entry, lives in the Health row)
- One row per day in `atlas_sleep_logs`, keyed on `entry_date UNIQUE` (midnight, not 6am-shifted).
- Fields: duration_minutes, sleep_score, deep_minutes, rem_minutes, resting_hr, hrv, note, morning_note.
- Modal for logging (two-step: metrics, then morning reflection).
- **Header promoted (2026-07-27, post-Comet review):** "Sleep" 13px → 17px/700, plus a 28px lilac icon chip (`.health-panel-icon.lilac`) matching the hero KPI card language. Edit/Log button upgraded from a bare text link to a bordered pill (`.health-edit-btn`, shared class with Workout's).
- **Notes redesigned as three selector-PILL chips (2026-07-27, v4 — true two-layer depth):** "Tonight's summary" (reuses the existing `sleepSummary` getter, unchanged) / "Morning reflection" / "Context", each with a tiny icon (moon / sun / message-square) in `.health-chip-head`. The three chips sit inside a shared `.health-chip-stack` "track" (`--surface-2`, 4px padding, 12px radius) with each `.health-chip` rendered as a raised "pill" (`--surface-1` + `var(--top-edge), var(--shadow-card)`, 9px radius) — the exact same two-layer depth system as the Workout day-type toggle (`.wo-daytype-group` track / `.wo-daytype-chip[aria-pressed="true"]` pill), just with all three pills permanently "active" since they're always simultaneously relevant. Gentle `translateY(-2px)` + shadow-upgrade on hover, using the same `--dur-base`/`--ease-out` tokens every other card-hover in the app uses. An empty chip shows italic placeholder text (`.health-chip-value.inactive`) instead of disappearing. This is the third and (per Abhishek's "almost satisfied, ship it") final iteration of the sleep-notes treatment: `.sleep-card-note` colored-chip box → `.health-note` plain-divider → `.health-chip` flat card → `.health-chip` pill-depth.
- **Inline 14-day trend, sparkline with sage/coral echo (2026-07-27, v4):** bottom-anchored SVG line + soft sage gradient fill + dashed goal reference line, computed by the `sleepSparkline` getter (`js/pages/today.js`) from `sleepTrendDays`/`sleepGoalMinutes` — only real logged nights become points, a missing night is a gap in the line (never a fake flat value). Chart height 46px → 80px. The line itself is drawn as individual `<line>` segments (not one `<polyline>`) so each segment can carry its own sage/coral colour depending on whether that night was above or below the goal line (`sleepSparkline.segments[i].above`) — same at-a-glance scoring the old bar chart gave, without going back to bars. The gradient area fill stays a single soft sage wash regardless, so the colour shift reads as an accent, not a second chart. Coloring goes entirely through CSS classes (`.health-spark-line.above/.below`, `.health-spark-dot.above/.below`), never inline `var()` in SVG attributes.
- **"Attach screenshot (future AI)" placeholder (2026-07-27):** small inline text+icon link (`.health-attach-link`) — `disabled`, no upload logic, no Supabase field.

### Today page — Workout panel (manual entry + day-type toggle, lives in the Health row)
- **Header promoted (2026-07-27, v3):** same treatment as Sleep — 17px/700 title + 28px blue icon chip. Exactly two header actions (gear for targets, `.health-edit-btn` pill for sessions) — this was already the minimal set, just visually upgraded.
- **Day-type chips (Round 2 build):** three chips at the top — Workout · Active recovery · Full rest. Selected chip gets accent-tinted background. Persists per day via `day_type` column (migration 013).
- **Content reordered (2026-07-27, v3, post-Comet review):** Day-type toggle → **Today's sessions (main focus, unmoved visual style — no colored bars, no emoji)** → "This week" targets strip (`.health-targets-strip`, demoted) → 4-week consistency. Previously targets sat above sessions; Abhishek/Comet flagged that as backwards from what actually gets looked at first.
- **Session row controls consolidated (2026-07-27, v3):** the two spaced `.btn-text` Edit/Delete links replaced with one tight icon-button group (`.wo-session-actions-v2` / `.wo-icon-btn`, pencil + trash). Same underlying `openWorkoutSessionForm()`/`deleteWorkoutSession()` calls, unchanged — `deleteWorkoutSession()`'s `askConfirm()` delete-confirm flow was not touched.
- **Session rows get the same selector-pill depth as the Sleep chips (2026-07-27, v5):** Abhishek explicitly flagged that the pill treatment landed on Sleep but not Workout — `.wo-session-stack` (new track, `--surface-2`, 4px padding, 12px radius) now wraps the session list, and `.wo-session-row` itself is the raised pill (`--surface-1` + `var(--top-edge), var(--shadow-card)`, same hover lift as the sleep chips). Each row also gets a small muted icon (`.wo-session-icon`, `--text-secondary`, NOT colour-coded per activity type) via the new `sessionIconSvg(type)` helper in `today.js` — a fixed 5-entry lookup (strength/cardio_walk/yoga_stretch/active_play/cleaning) rendered with `x-html` (safe: `type` only ever comes from the session form's fixed `<select>`, never free text). `.wo-session-actions-v2`'s own background flipped `--surface-1`→`--surface-2` so the Edit/Delete icon cluster still reads as a distinct control now that the row underneath it is `--surface-1`. Only Today's inline session list changed — the separate "Workout Sessions" modal list keeps its own unrelated `.card.panel` row style.
- **Weekly targets strip:** `--surface-2` recessed block, no border, "This week" micro-label above it.
- **Active recovery state:** calm lilac walking-dot pulse + "Active recovery day / Logged — no details to enter."
- **Full rest state:** pulsing blue moon + "Full rest day / Nothing to log. Sleep well tonight."
- **4-week consistency, redesigned as an aggregated weekly strip (2026-07-27, v3):** one larger cell per week (`.health-week-cell`, 38×38px) instead of a dot per activity-type per week — computed by the `workoutWeekAggregate` getter (`js/pages/today.js`), purely derived from the existing `workoutConsistency`/`workoutTrendWeeks` data (no new loading, no schema change). A week is 'met' only if every activity type hit its target, 'missed' only if none did, else 'partial'. Shared legend (`.health-legend`) **right-aligned on the "4-WEEK CONSISTENCY" caption line (2026-07-27, v4)**, mirroring how "Avg" sits next to "14-DAY TREND" on Sleep — saves a line of vertical space vs. the legend sitting below the cells.
- **"Attach screenshot (future AI)" placeholder:** same small inline link treatment as Sleep's.
- All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

**Removed 2026-07-27 (morning pass):** the standalone full-width "Health Trends" card that used to sit at the very bottom of Today, with its own Sleep/Workout tab toggle — both trends now live inline in their respective panel. `loadHealthTrend()` and its underlying data (`sleepTrendDays`, `workoutConsistency`, `sleepAvg7`) are unchanged; only where/how the template reads them has changed (twice, same day) — first to compact bars/dot-rows, then to the sparkline/aggregated-strip described above after a Comet visual review flagged the first pass as still not right.

**Known pre-existing bug found in passing, not yet fixed (2026-07-27):** a small region of `Deploy/css/components.css` (the `.project-card-completed`/`.running-card`/`.running-note`/`.trv2-pause-reason` rules, tagged "/* v1.2 updates */") is encoded as UTF-16 with embedded NUL bytes inside the otherwise-UTF-8 file — almost certainly means `.running-card`/`.running-note`/`.trv2-pause-reason` render unstyled in production today, since a NUL byte in a stylesheet becomes U+FFFD and breaks those selectors. `.project-card-completed` has a working duplicate defined correctly elsewhere in the file, so it's unaffected. Unrelated to Phase 5 Health — flagged as a spawned task, not fixed in this pass.

### Today page — Daily journal
- Hidden by default. Small pencil-icon button next to the H1 toggles `journalOpen`.
- Composer writes to `atlas_notebook_entries` on the midnight-calendar `entry_date` (same table Notebook overlay uses).
- **Date rule locked:** notebook + daily-journal use midnight calendar date. Checklist + streaks use the 6am rollover. See CLAUDE.md.

### Projects list page
- Grid of project cards (monogram + name + description + status + task count on click-to-expand).
- **Separation of states:** Divided into "Running Projects" and "Completed Projects" sections.
- **Completed cards visual state:** Uses `.project-card-completed` (lilac tint surface), replacing the initials with the native checkmark SVG, and featuring a clean `.system-text` "Completed" caption without any faked timestamps.
- **"+ Add note" button** (Round 2 build): opens a modal composer. Notes only render below after the first save. Persistent empty Notes card removed.
- **New Project modal (Round 2 build):** name + color + monogram + description + optional **Short-term goal + target date + Long-term goal + target date** as a labelled subsection. Create fully-formed in one step.

### Project workspace page
- **Back to Projects** button top-left.
- **Hero card:** coloured project dot + 34 px serif title + status pill on the left • description below • three summary metrics • progress bar. On the right: ⋮ overflow menu (Edit goals • Mark as completed / Reopen project • Archive project • Delete project) + goals stacked.
- **Goal-edit modal:** opened by clicking either goal or the ⋮ menu's "Edit goals." Both goals editable together.
- **Running now** section: only when a task is `in_progress`. Styled strictly with semantic `.heading-label`, `.focus-text`, and `.system-text`.
- **Tasks section:** same `.trv2-row` anatomy as Today. Task pause/resume mechanics exist (clicking "Pause task" in the edit modal resets it to `not_started`).
- **Read-only state:** If a project is completed, the workspace blocks new task additions, new log additions, and goal editing. Reopening requires a non-destructive `askConfirm` and captures a reopen reason into the task log.
- **Workspace task modal:** mirrors Today's shape — same eyebrow + name + Schedule/Assignment tiers + inline Delete. Project field auto-locked to this workspace's project.
- **▶ Start** as a subtle inline button in the meta line for `not_started` tasks — opens the existing `askNote()` "what are you doing right now?" prompt, then transitions to `in_progress`.
- **Two-tap done confirm** on the row's checkbox (same as Today). Completing a task auto-creates a "Completed: {name}" Work log entry.
- **Work log section:** day-grouped, expandable. Add entry form + log lines (time · body · Edit).

### Notebook overlay
- Header icon button toggles the overlay.
- Today's entry composer + "Save" (upsert on `entry_date UNIQUE`).
- Past entries listed below with individual delete + Restore-via-view.

### Restore view (config-driven)
- Header icon button opens the overlay.
- Nine collapsed-by-default sections, each showing count: Projects, Tasks, Notebook entries, Project notes, Task logs, Checklist items, Checklist history, Sleep logs, Workout logs.
- Restore (via RPC) + "Delete forever" (hard delete, second confirmation modal).
- Config-driven via `SECTION_DEFS` — adding a 10th soft-deletable entity is one entry there + matching db.js methods.

### Universal time picker (Round 2 build)
- Shared Alpine `timePicker12h` component + `.tp-numeric` markup: two 2-digit numeric HH/MM inputs + AM/PM segmented control.
- `inputmode="numeric"` opens the OS number pad on mobile.
- Same at every consumer: Today task modal, workspace task modal, checklist Log popup.
- Internal `.value` is still a 24-hour "HH:MM" string; no consumer's read/write code changed.

### Streaks (Phase 2)
- `atlas_targets` rows with `kind='streak'` on the Today hero band.
- Real day count via plain calendar diff from `streak_start_date` (not 6am-shifted).
- Relapse action → modal → `atlas_targets_log_relapse` RPC. Grace day = keeps streak alive, flips `grace_used` true. Otherwise resets `streak_start_date` and updates `previous_best_days`. Reason always required and always logged.

### Sync + reliability
- Local-first: no. Atlas is fully online — every mutation is a live network call.
- Every write verified (`.select().single()` or RPC `RETURNING *`).
- Soft-delete only. `deleted_at IS NULL` filter on every read (Restore view is the exception).
- `askConfirm()` for every destructive action. Never `window.confirm()`.
- 8-second undo toast on every soft-delete.

### Live schema (migrations 001–013)
Every migration applied. Current tables (all `atlas_` prefix, all RLS enabled):
`atlas_projects`, `atlas_tasks`, `atlas_task_logs`, `atlas_project_notes`, `atlas_notebook_entries`, `atlas_checklist_items`, `atlas_checklist_history`, `atlas_sleep_logs`, `atlas_workout_logs` (now with `day_type`), `atlas_targets`, `atlas_streak_relapses`, plus `atlas_activity` (unused placeholder from an early migration).

## MOCKUP-ONLY / designed but not yet built

**None as of 2026-07-26.** Design Review Rounds 1 and 2 are both fully shipped; there is no approved mockup sitting in the wings waiting for build. The Round 2 mockup artifact ([https://claude.ai/code/artifact/6569b321-ce74-4c36-a017-d404285123a7](https://claude.ai/code/artifact/6569b321-ce74-4c36-a017-d404285123a7)) is now historical reference — everything in it shipped as commit `2db6348`.

---

## PLANNED but not yet mocked

Nothing in this list is on the current sprint. Each is a candidate for the next design review round when Abhishek re-opens it.

### Sleep/Workout — AI screenshot parsing
Full sleep-side plan in [`handover-docs/SLEEP-ROADMAP.md`](handover-docs/SLEEP-ROADMAP.md). The trend roll-up chart itself shipped 2026-07-27 (inline compact trend in each Health panel — see "Removed 2026-07-27" note above); what's left:
1. **Screenshot parser** — upload ring/workout-app screenshot → Vertex AI (existing `VERTEX_API_KEY_POS`) → review-before-save modal. Both panels already have a non-functional "Attach screenshot (future AI)" placeholder button (`.health-attach-btn`, `disabled`, no upload logic, no schema change) marking where this wires in.
2. **Pattern-of-life insights** — weekly correlations (e.g. "sleep score dropped 8 pts on the four nights you logged a workout after 10pm"). Requires 30+ days of data, now available from the trend data already being collected.

### Workout day-type toggle — weekly pattern setter
Round 2 built the per-day toggle. A follow-up would let Abhishek set default patterns (e.g. "Sundays are always Full Rest by default"). Deferred; ships only if he asks.

### Phase 3 — Targets goal-cards (`count_toward_goal`)
`atlas_targets` already exists with `kind='streak'` shipping. The `count_toward_goal` kind (progress bars, cumulative counters) is the other half — sketched in earlier `plan.md` but not started. Awaits Abhishek's go-ahead.

### Notebook — floating draggable window
Currently a modal overlay. A floating draggable variant (stay open while using the rest of the app) was scoped-out for later. Deferred.

### Time picker — full numpad variant
Round 2 shipped the simpler two-input variant. A phone-clock-app style numpad grid (~120 lines) was flagged as a further follow-up. Deferred.

### Visual-hierarchy pass on Projects list + Notebook
Round 1 covered Today. Round 2 covered the Project workspace. A similar polish pass on the Projects list surface and the Notebook overlay was scoped-out for later. Deferred.

### AI-teacher / conversational layer
The old app has a full AI-layer plan (`handover-docs/AI-LAYER-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` in the sibling repo). Nothing equivalent has been planned for Atlas. Would be its own multi-round design review if Abhishek wants it.

---

## Open questions / decisions pending

**None active as of 2026-07-27.** Round 4 shipped cleanly; Abhishek confirmed the project lifecycle direction and token refreshes. Sleep trend placement (below) was resolved this session — inline in-panel, not a shared overlay.

Standing "would want an answer before starting" items — these are not blocking anything now, but they'd need addressing before their respective phase begins:
- **Completed project card design:** The Phase 4 card design works technically and adheres to Atlas styling, but is visually unsatisfying / washed out. This is a known, accepted pending state. It should be treated as a future project-section polish item, not as an active bug to be fixed immediately.
- **Weekly-pattern setter for workout day-types** — is this worth building, or does the per-day toggle cover the real use case well enough?
- **Phase 3 Targets** — does Abhishek still want `count_toward_goal` targets, or is the streak side (which already ships) enough for now?

---

## Recommended next sequence

If Abhishek picks the work back up without a new brief, the sequence I'd suggest:

1. **Live-test the Round 2 build** on the deployed app once the current deploy settles. Real interaction on: fixed-height Tasks card with many tasks, universal numeric time picker on mobile, workout day-type toggle, goals-in-hero, delete-in-edit-modal, project chip contrast on both themes, checklist ring skipped colour.
2. **Fix anything that surfaces from that live test** — treat as a small third pass on the same Round 2 scope. Standard "iterate the artifact if visual, otherwise straight-to-build" flow.
3. **Choose the next design review round.** Options in priority order (my read):
   - **(a) Projects list polish** — the surface hasn't had a hierarchy pass; a few Comet-observation items are still open (colored status dot unclear, "add another project" affordance).
   - **(b) Sleep trend roll-up** — 30-day chart. Small build, high user value, unlocks the AI features later.
   - **(c) Notebook layout pass** — from the same deferred-list bucket as Projects.
4. **AFTER (a)–(c), consider Phase 3 (Targets `count_toward_goal`)** — the streak side is proven, the DB is ready, the workspace hero already has a metrics slot that could host progress numbers. Design-review it first; don't build.
5. **AFTER Phase 3, consider the sleep AI stages** in the order documented in `handover-docs/SLEEP-ROADMAP.md`.

Nothing on this list starts without Abhishek re-opening the conversation.

## Hard reminders

- **Read `CLAUDE.md` before writing code.** The rules live there, and they're non-negotiable without asking.
- **Read the last 2–3 `SESSION_LOG.md` entries** at the start of your session — that tells you what the previous agent shipped and any state that isn't in the codebase yet.
- **Append your own `SESSION_LOG.md` entry at the end** — same format. Don't skip.
- **Commit and push after every completed pass in Atlas.** Do not hand off "waiting to push" — Abhishek can't review from localhost.
- **Local dev = production DB.** Do not sign in and click around locally.
